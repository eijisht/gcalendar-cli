# cli-gcalendar

## Overview
I find the google calendar UI unintuitive and clunky whenever I need to add multiple events (e. g. Midterms and finals at the start of a semester). To streamline the process, I decided to make a little terminal based program to make scheduling events quick and easy, with a GNU-style CLI, so it stays consistent with other terminal commands.


## Why Golang?
I decided to use Golang as I have been learning the language and wanted to apply it in a practical, real-world use case.


## Roadmap
* Create events
* Read from calendar
* Update events
* Delete events

* Add config file support
* Add caching
